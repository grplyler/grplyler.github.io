> A hackable text editor for the 21st Century

The other day I stumbled across an absolute jewel.
After reading
[one of Tom Preston-Weners blog posts](http://tom.preston-werner.com/2014/04/21/farewell-github-hello-immersive-computing.html)
I decided to check out the repositories he had contributed to.
One of his contributions was towards a projects named "[Atom](http://atom.io/)".
The projects name sparked my curiously as it looked terribly cool.

As you can see from the image above. it _**is**_ totally cool.
This Powerhouse of a code editor was amazing once i opened it
up on my mac. Besides being really fully featured with an amazing
interface, its also open source!
See for yourself, straight from the website:

> ### Full-featured, right out of the box
> - Fuzzy finder for quickly opening files
> - Fast project-wide search and replace
> - Multiple cursors and selections
> - Multiple panes
> - Snippets
> - Code folding
> - A clean preferences UI
> - Import TextMate grammars and themes

I'll do less writing and let you do more looking.
Look at this Preferences window! It pulls up as a tab in your
workspace!

I have been using Atom for few days how and really enjoy it.
Another cool functionality it includes is a command line script.
Say you are working in a Terminal, and just want to open a whole
project in atom, just type `atom` and it will open Atom with
the files and folders in your current working directory.
